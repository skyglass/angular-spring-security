<h1>{{ userName }}</h1>
<p>
See how the breadcrumbs show the user name in uppercase? That's because we are able to specify 
values that are made available by the state's <code>resolve</code> object, and interpolate
against them. In this case, we specified <code ng-non-bindable>{{ userName | uppercase }}</code>.

  <a class="btn btn-primary" ui-sref="skyglass.users.detail.image">View an image</a> - This will not affect the breadcrumbs.
